The angel said to Zechariah, “Your wife will have a son. You will name him John. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, and will prepare the people for the Messiah!” Zechariah responded, “My wife and I are too old to have children! How can I know this will happen?”

The angel responded to Zechariah, “I was sent by God to bring you this good news. Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born.” Immediately, Zechariah was unable to speak. Then the angel left Zechariah. After this, Zechariah returned home and his wife became pregnant.

After Elizabeth gave birth to her baby boy, Zechariah and Elizabeth named the baby John, as the angel had commanded. Then God allowed Zechariah to speak again. Zechariah said, “Praise God, because he has remembered his people!
