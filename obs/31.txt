So, Peter got out of the boat and started walking to Jesus on the surface of the water. But after walking a short distance, he turned his eyes away from Jesus and began to look at the waves and to feel the strong wind.

Then Peter became afraid and began to sink in the water. He cried out, “Master, save me!” Jesus reached out right away and grabbed him. Then he said to Peter, “You man of little faith, why did you doubt?”

When Peter and Jesus got into the boat, the wind immediately stopped blowing and the water became calm. The disciples were amazed. They worshiped Jesus, saying to him, “Truly, you are the Son of God.”
