“Not long after that, a Levite came down the road. (Levites were a tribe of Jews who helped the priests at the Temple.) The Levite also crossed over to the other side of the road and ignored the man who had been robbed and beaten.”

“The next person to walk down that road was a Samaritan. (Samaritans were the descendants of Jews who had married people from other nations. Samaritans and Jews hated each other.) But when the Samaritan saw the Jewish man, he felt very strong compassion for him. So he cared for him and bandaged his wounds.”

“The Samaritan then lifted the man onto his own donkey and took him to a roadside inn where he took care of him.”

“The next day, the Samaritan needed to continue his journey. He gave some money to the person in charge of the inn and said, ‘Take care of him, and if you spend any more money than this, I will repay those expenses when I return.’”

Then Jesus asked the law expert, “What do you think? Which one of the three men was a neighbor to the man who was robbed and beaten?” He replied, “The one who was merciful to him.” Jesus told him, “You go and do the same.”
